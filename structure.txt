Smart Closet Organizer
Basic Features
Digitize Your Wardrobe

Functionality: Users can add items to their digital wardrobe by taking photos, categorizing them (e.g., tops, bottoms, accessories), and adding details like color, size, and brand.
Technologies: Camera integration, image handling, and basic CRUD operations for managing wardrobe items.
Plan Outfits

Functionality: Users can create outfits by combining different wardrobe items and saving them for future reference.
Technologies: Drag-and-drop interface, data storage for outfits, and simple UI design.
Track Clothing Usage

Functionality: Users can log when they wear each item, helping them track usage frequency and identify items they rarely use.
Technologies: Date handling, usage logs, and basic analytics to show usage patterns.
Intermediate Features
Weather-Based Outfit Suggestions

Functionality: Provide outfit suggestions based on the current weather. Users enter their location, and the app retrieves weather data to suggest appropriate outfits.
Technologies: Integration with weather APIs, conditional logic for outfit suggestions, and advanced UI elements.
Integration with Online Shopping

Functionality: Suggest items for purchase based on gaps in the user's wardrobe. For example, if the user lacks a certain type of clothing, the app suggests online stores where they can purchase these items.
Technologies: Integration with e-commerce APIs, web scraping (if needed), and recommendations engine.
Advanced Features
Virtual Try-On Using AR
Functionality: Allow users to virtually try on clothes using augmented reality. They can see how an outfit looks on them without physically wearing it.
Technologies: AR integration (using libraries like ViroReact or ARKit), real-time image processing, and 3D modeling.
